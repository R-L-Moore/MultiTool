##Usage:

A c++ console program, created to combine a number of functions which can be run on command, rather than manually accessing/opening them, or having multiple windows open.

Currently, this has the following functions:
 - A kb converter, with formatting/checks for mb, gb and tb results
 - the AutoPing and ProcessKill tools
 - an "offline files fix" to resolve issues with the offline files database
